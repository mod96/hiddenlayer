<h5>done with basic colab device & colab pro device (1~2 : mostly used basic colab, 3~ & VAE, GAN, ... : mostly used colab pro)</h5>
<ul>
<li>1 : baseline of the project</li>
  
<li>2 : how i learned to use bicubic interpolation & several model test</li>
  
<li>3 : testbench by separating train/valid/test.</li>
  
<li>4 : train & submission</li>
  
<li>VAE : I trained simple VAE to make extra data..but it was not good enough to use</li>
  
<li>GAN : I trained simple GAN and it did great job...but as i needed label & digit, it gone wrong.</li>
  
<li>NoisyStudent : I searched 'https://paperswithcode.com/sota/image-classification-on-imagenet', and tried to use the method of FixEfficientNet. Then realized that they used the method of NoisyStudent. I tried to manipulate. But the result wasn't good.</li>

<li>final submission - Ensemble : trained 10 models including 5 EfficientNetB5 and 5 InceptionResNetV2, chose 6~7 models that have sufficiently large accuracy</li>
</ul>
