done with basic colab device & colab pro device (1~2 : mostly used basic colab, 3~ & VAE, GAN, ... : mostly used colab pro)

1 : baseline of the project
2 : how i learned to use bicubic interpolation & several model test
3 : testbench by separating train/valid/test.
4 : train & submission
VAE : I trained simple VAE to make extra data..but it was not good enough to use
GAN : I trained simple GAN and it did great job...but as i needed label & digit, it gone wrong.
NoisyStudent : I searched 'https://paperswithcode.com/sota/image-classification-on-imagenet', and tried to use the method of FixEfficientNet. Then realized that they used the method of NoisyStudent. I tried to manipulate. But the result wasn't good.

final submission - Ensemble : trained 10 models including 5 EfficientNetB5 and 5 InceptionResNetV2, chose 6~7 models that have sufficiently large accuracy
