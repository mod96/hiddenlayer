0 : I simply ran https://keras.io/examples/vision/retinanet/ and explored what COCO data looked like.

1 : I tried the baseline provided by dacon, made the data to geojson format, and tried yolov3 provided by medium.

RetinaPrep : I got the geojson that was created to let Retinanet learn. The result wasn't good.

Practice : I've tried a variety of models, half giving up. Among them, I succeeded in applying the code of BBAVectors-Oriented-Object-Detection in the direction I wanted, and I got good results.


It's a pity that I haven't tried more because I have a lot to prepare for, such as interviews and exams. However, I was able to understand the object detection in a short period of time, which was not bad.
