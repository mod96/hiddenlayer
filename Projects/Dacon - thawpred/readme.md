<h4>The competition is not over yet, but it is summarized and uploaded for resume upload.</h4>

<p>
Most tests were conducted with RTX2060 in a local environment, but due to a 6GB limitation, it was difficult to quantify the performance of each model. 

For the final submission, I trained some locally identified good models in the colab pro P100 environment.
